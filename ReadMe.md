NORMALIZED METRIC DISPLAY

The purpose of the chart is to display the metrics obtained from NLP exercises. 

How to use: 
Select what you want to see in the dropdown menus at the top, click draw, and your desired graph will be generated on screen.

Features:
    Tooltip - Hover your mouse over any point on the graph to see its exact values
    Visibility toggle - Click on any name in the legend to make that line appear/disappear

Notes:
- The line colours are hard coded in the system, if you want more colours or different colours the colours array is at around line 255 in script.js
- The code is written to parse a very specific set of data. Be careful when trying to change where the data is being grabbed from.
